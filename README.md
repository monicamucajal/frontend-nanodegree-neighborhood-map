# Neighborhood Map Project

## Information about the project


#### Basic Functionality
This project displays a map (provided by Google maps APIs) with markers for a handful of locations nearby the Palos Verdes and South Bay area.  There is a side bar listing the mapped locations that provides the ability to filter the list.  Clicking on a marker brings up an Info Window with information provided by a (not premium) Foursquare API.

#### Challenges
Overall this was an extremely complex project.  Could not make the new Yelp Fusion API work (later read on the forums that there was a limitation of making client calls to the Yelp Fusion API).
